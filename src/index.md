# Mathias Lindholm

I’m a Helsinki-based designer with a love for mountain biking, pizza, craft beer and the great outdoors.

For the past 10 years, I’ve worked as a designer across various business sectors, delivering successful digital products in outstanding teams.

Currently I’m working at [Neverthink](https://about.neverthink.tv/).
