Competition entry for Adprofit 2013 junior series. The ad plays with the idea that the students scope is quite narrow and it could be broadened by reading Helsingin Sanomat. The illustrations were made using torn pieces of paper. 

Made together with [Teemu Markkanen](https://fi.linkedin.com/pub/teemu-markkanen/46/8ab/693).
