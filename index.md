Moi. I’m a designer from Helsinki working with digital products and services. I spend most of my days designing user interfaces, developing brand identities and occasionally i design type. I also know a thing or two about web development. I work as a designer over at [Reaktor](http://reaktor.fi).

Previously I’ve worked [here](http://ddb.fi/), [here](http://www.bond.fi/) and [here](http://barabra.fi/). Before that I studied at Arcada University of Applied Sciences from where I graduated in 2012 with my Bachelor of Arts degree.

In my free time I enjoy riding my bikes, hiking, traveling, podcasts, the internet and a good coffee. I can be found on [tumblr](http://mlindholm.tumblr.com/), [twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/thisismatu), [designspiration](http://designspiration.net/mlindholm/), [flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/matu187/) and [github](https://github.com/mlindholm).

Im not accepting client work at this time but if you want to contact me tweet me at [@thisismatu](https://twitter.com/#!/thisismatu).
